# GSI-Switch
More and more websites bring up this annoying and cumbersome window : 'Sign In with Google' (GSI)
Take back control of your browser : GSI message box only when you need it !
Install GSI-switch (Mozilla compatible) and pin it up in the toolbar.
Any GSI popup will be blocked until you click the add-on icon.
